FourierTransform
================
After you select an image from the local gallery (using the button
"Select Image") you need to press "Apply FFT" in order to actually
transform the image into a matrix of grayscale values. After that you
need to slide to the left and you will get: "Amplitude FFT Image",
"Phase FFT Image", "FFT Fourier log image", and also "Original Image
after applying the inverse FFT", where FFT = Fast Fourier Transform.
The image which you bring to the app should be a square image of 2^n
pixels (e.g.: 1024 x 1024; 512 x 512;  256 x 256) because of the formula of Fourier Transform.


Please read the document Fourier FOURIER TRANSFORM.docx from the main folder for more informations!

Some example of images to use are located in the "Example of Images to Use". You should include this images into the Gallery of your iPhone / iPad and after that you will be able to apply on it the Fourier Transform!
