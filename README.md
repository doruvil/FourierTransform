FourierTransform
================
After you select an image from the local gallery (using the button
"Select Image") you need to press "Apply FFT" in order to actually
transform the image into a matrix of grayscale values. After that you
need to slide to the left and you will get: "Amplitude FFT Image",
"Phase FFT Image", "FFT Fourier log image", and also "Original Image
after applying the inverse FFT", where FFT = Fast Fourier Transform.
The image which you bring to the app should be a square image of 2^n
pixels (e.g.: 1024 x 1024)
